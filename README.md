This a fork of some outdated or abandonned armors and apparels, meant to use with CE only. Those apparels were unpatched for CE, so I included whole compatibility in the defs (No vanilla compatible!).

Contains :

- WW1 German Trench Armor, for more early-industrial variety. It can protect you early game but is very heavy to wear.

- WWW2 Soviet Plate Armor, for even more early-industrial variety. It has the same protection than german's one but is a bit lighter to wear.
